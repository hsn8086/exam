Hello everyone,  

Today, I’d like to share my dream job with you — becoming a skilled backend engineer.  

I’ve been programming for seven years, and over the years, I’ve cultivated a deep passion for solving complex problems and building reliable systems. I started working with Java five years ago, which gave me a strong foundation in software development. Three years ago, I began using Python, broadening my expertise and allowing me to handle a wider range of backend development tasks effectively.  

Recently, I’ve also pushed myself further by competing in programming contests. Last month, I participated in the China Collegiate Programming Contest Chongqing Regional Contest, and earlier this month, I joined the International Collegiate Programming Contest Asia Kunming Regional Contest. The CCPC and the ICPC, are not just prestigious competitions but also opportunities to challenge myself under pressure and learn from top-tier competitors worldwide.  

My dream is to use these skills and experiences to design and maintain backend systems that are fast, secure, and scalable. I believe this field allows me to make a significant impact by solving real-world problems and contributing to innovative projects.  

Thank you for listening!
